              <p class="text-justify line_h14">Latin America has a population of around 650 million people, mainly living in cities. Water is a critical resource for the region. Continuous action is urgently needed to restore water sources and develop further mechanisms to conserve water so that the people of the region can enjoy access to water today, without compromising access to water for future generations.</p>
              <p class="text-justify line_h14"><span class="textField-main line_h14">In order to address this critical issue, the Water Funds model was developed. Water Funds are supported by the Latin American Water Funds Partnership, an agreement between the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), FEMSA Foundation, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The Partnership operates throughout the region and has developed local initiatives across several countries.</span></p>

              <p class="text-justify line_h14">As an organization committed to sustainable agriculture and advancing life, in Israel, we identified an opportunity to change the eating habits for better health, support food security and inspire young children to respect the land. The Arab city of Baqa al-Gharbiyye, less than 10 kilometers from our Magal factory in Israel, has 30,000 inhabitants. Life expectancy in Baqa al-Garbbiyye was estimated at 65 years, where in Israel, the average life expectancy is 80 years. The prevalence of obesity in  kindergarten children in this city is very significant, increasing as they grow. Lifestyle and nutritional habits play a major role, so we sought a sustainable way to help our local community be healthier and live longer.</p>
              <p class="text-justify line_h14">In 2014, our drip irrigation specialist, Netafim, joined forces with the local municipality, a local academic college and partnering nonprofits to establish a program of community vegetable gardens in local kindergartens.</p>
              <p class="text-justify line_h14">Netafim provided the drip irrigation kits for the vegetable gardens and more than 60 employee volunteers supported the training of the kindergarten staff in their installation and use. Once established, the children and their families tended the gardens to grow fresh produce.</p>

              <p class="text-justify line_h14">Parents were also offered training on healthy dietary habits for their children and for the entire family.</p>

              <p class="text-justify line_h14">A further outcome of this ongoing initiative is that, the local government now mandates that every new kindergarten established in the city will have a community vegetable garden.

              <p class="text-justify">In Colombia, we support small family-owned hardware stores where family members have not had formal training in business management or product trends. Competing with larger players in hardware supplies, these small stores need to manage their operations effectively to survive. Our Pavco brand in Colombia established a digital learning platform for store owners to provide education in marketing, inventory management, accounting and more. The menu of courses is available to all hardware store owners for them to use at their convenience. In 2018, we added four new courses to the program.</p>
              <p class="text-justify"><span class="textField-main">Since 2016, 1,351 store-owners or family members have taken at least one course, more than 8,700 have visited the training website and 221 participants have received a certification showing they have completed a program of courses.</span></p>

We show our solidarity with our neighbors by acting quickly and without hesitation to provide funds, resources and in many cases, the volunteer efforts of our employees, in support of disaster relief efforts.</p>
              <p class="text-justify line_h14">In Mexico, in 2018, we continued to support the ongoing community relief efforts following the 8.1o magnitude earthquake that struck off the Mexican coast in late 2017. Over 200 people were killed in the earthquake which was the second-most devastating earthquake in Mexico since 1985. Two weeks later another earthquake hit central Mexico. As a result of these two disasters, tens of thousands of people and their families lost their homes and entire villages were wiped out.</p>
              <p class="text-justify line_h14">Following this crisis, our parent company Kaluz, and its charitable foundation, Fundación Kaluz, rapidly established the Reconstructing Mexico Initiative (Iniciativa Reconstruyendo México), to provide a framework for all our group companies to provide immediate and medium-term relief.</p>
